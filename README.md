## Add highcharts to the page with ajax.

This package use highcharts 6.0.x.

To connect the highchart, you have to set the class `js-chart` and an `id`.
To connect the chart settings, you can bind on the id of the div. (e.g. `js-charts-line`)
In the `Charts.config` you can set all the settings for the chart.
You can set the chart title in `data-chart-title`.
You can also set the ajax url in the `data-chart-url`
The JSON contain the data and the name.
The labels for the x, y and z axis can also be set the data attributes (e.g. `data-chart-xaxis-title`)
Other information must be set in the config.

See also the example files in the test folder.


## Load the complete series from the ajax request.

If you want to load the complete series from the ajax request, add the `data-chart-dynamic` attribute.
Now all the information in the serie will be set, like data, name and type.
You don't have to preset the series in the config, it will add all series from the ajax request.

```
Charts.loaded = 0;

...

chart: {
    events: {
        load: function() {

            if(Charts.loaded == Object.keys(Charts.items).length) {
                ...
            }
